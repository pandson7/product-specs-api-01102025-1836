# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an API system for accessing product specifications with flexible JSON schema storage. The system will provide RESTful endpoints to retrieve product information including name, category, brand, and other dynamic attributes stored in a NoSQL database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store product specifications in a flexible JSON format, so that I can accommodate varying product attributes without schema constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL accept JSON documents with flexible schema
2. WHEN product data contains standard fields (name, category, brand) THE SYSTEM SHALL index these for efficient retrieval
3. WHEN product data is persisted THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain data integrity and consistency

### Requirement 2: Product Retrieval API
**User Story:** As a client application, I want to retrieve product specifications via REST API, so that I can display product information to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a GET request is made to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return all products in JSON format
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return a specific product by ID
3. WHEN no products exist THE SYSTEM SHALL return an empty array with 200 status
4. WHEN a product ID doesn't exist THE SYSTEM SHALL return 404 status with error message

### Requirement 3: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want sample product data to be automatically populated, so that I can test the API functionality immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL populate the database with sample product data
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories and brands
3. WHEN sample data is accessed via API THE SYSTEM SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses

### Requirement 4: API Performance and Reliability
**User Story:** As a client application, I want the API to respond quickly and reliably, so that users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them without degradation
3. WHEN errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
